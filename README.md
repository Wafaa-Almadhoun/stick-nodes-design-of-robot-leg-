## Introduction
Stepper motors are an ideal choice for accurately moving and positioning mechanical devices. Using techniques like microstepping the position of the motor shaft can be controlled with a great deal of precision, stepper Motors are used in a wide variety of devices ranging from 3D printers and CNC machines to DVD drives, heating ducts, and even analog clocks , stepper motors are DC motors that rotate in precise increments or ‚Äústeps‚Äù.

  ,We will cover several topics : üëç 


 1. Unipolar Stepper with ULN2003.
 2. Bipolar Stepper with L293D Motor Driver IC.
 3. BIG Stepper Motors NEMA 23 Bipolar with DM860A Microstep Driver .
